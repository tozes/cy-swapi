The goal of this exercise is to implement a **proof of concept** to automate tests for the public [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io).

## Requirements

- Use [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io) as your test runner
- You can add any external libraries to the project you'd like as long as they don't replace Cypress as the test runner
- Explore different aspects of API testing you believe are important
- Configure a simple CI pipeline to run your tests using a CI tool of your choice
- Implement tests for only a few endpoints (no need to cover the whole API)

Although there are some requirements, you don't have to limit yourself to what's defined by them so feel free to get creative and go beyond if you believe there's something else that can add value to the project! ðŸš€

What we'll look for when reviewing your solution:

- Clean, well organized and reusable code
- A solid solution we could build on top of

Once you're happy with your project, please upload it to a **private** repository and share it with us.

## How to bootstrap this project
